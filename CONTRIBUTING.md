=======================

Thank you for considering contributing to DevLint! 🎉 We appreciate your help in making this project better.

🛠 How to Contribute
--------------------

1.  git clone https://github.com/your-username/DevLint.git
    
2.  cd DevLint
    
3.  git checkout dev
    
4.  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    
5.  git add .git commit -m "feat: describe your change briefly"
    
6.  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    
7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR) to dev branch**
    
    *   Open a PR from feature/your-feature-name → dev on GitHub.
        
    *   Ensure your PR follows the coding and commit message guidelines.
        
8.  **Once approved, it will be merged into dev.**
    
9.  **Merging dev into main (Only When Stable)**
    
    *   After thorough testing, dev will be merged into main for releases.
        

🚀 Branching Strategy
---------------------

*   **main** → Stable, production-ready code.
    
*   **dev** → Active development branch.
    
*   **feature/**\* → Use this format for feature branches.
    

🔥 Code Guidelines
------------------

*   Follow SwiftFormat rules.
    
*   type: brief description (e.g., "feat: add dark mode support")
    
*   Write unit tests when possible.
    
*   Maintain clean and readable Swift code.
    

📜 Commit Message Convention
----------------------------

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

*   feat: → A new feature
    
*   fix: → A bug fix
    
*   docs: → Documentation changes
    
*   refactor: → Code restructuring without functional changes
    
*   test: → Adding or modifying tests
    
*   chore: → Maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates)
    

📝 Reporting Issues
-------------------

*   Before submitting an issue, **check if it's already reported**.
    
*   Provide clear details, screenshots, and error logs if possible.
    

🎯 Contribution Best Practices
------------------------------

*   Keep PRs **small and focused**.
    
*   Ensure **backward compatibility** where possible.
    
*   **Ask questions** if unsure—better communication leads to better code!
